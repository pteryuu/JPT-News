                    Crimson paint faded by a century of unrelenting Alaskan winters, the remains of Kennecott rise
                    from the wilderness, an anomaly of right angles against the jagged mountain landscape of
                    Wrangell - St Elias National Park. This early 20th-Century copper mining town once provided
                    comfort and community to hundreds of residents. Abandoned, reclaimed and now preserved,
                    Kennecott is the ghost town that helped electrify the US.

                <p>
                    In the 1900s, prospectors searching along the eastern edge of the Kennicott Glacier came upon
                    massive green cliffs of copper. Demand for copper wiring was skyrocketing as large-scale
                    electrification efforts swept the United States, and scions including J P Morgan and the
                    Guggenheim family saw opportunity. They formed the Alaska Syndicate, intent on accessing the
                    mineral riches of the Alaskan wilderness.

                <p>
                    By 1911, a railroad had been developed across inhospitable terrain, and the Kennecott mine and
                    mill were complete. At its peak, Kennecott employed 600 people. The work was gruelling â€“ the
                    temperature in the mines hovered around freezing and the hours were long. But according to
                    current local resident Kelly Bay, the community thrived. "They had big social events and ice
                    skating in winter," he said. The company town included a hospital, a school, recreation
                    facilities, a general store and even a dairy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The mine closed in 1938 after the ore deposits were depleted and global copper prices dropped.
                    The abandoned town began its return to wilderness once more, the buildings slowly crumbling. But
                    in the mid-1970s, people seeking a "hippie" lifestyle began slowly resettling the remains of the
                    town. According to writer and historian Ronald N Simpson, Kennecott became a place to escape to.
                    "There was no work out there or anything, but if people wanted a remote existence, they got one
                    out there," he said.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1978, Kennecott was listed on the US National Register of Historic Places, and was designated
                    a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 1998, the US National Park Service acquired many of the
                    buildings and much of the land and began restoring the site. Today, summer visitors make the
                    seven-hour drive east from Anchorage to stroll the streets of Kennecott, imagining anew the
                    challenges of life at the edge of the world.
