                    <p>
                        A decade ago, after a rained-out Thanksgiving desert camping trip with our five kids, my wife,
                        Kristin,
                        and I headed to the nearest available lodging, the now-shuttered Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas.
                        Watching
                        our brood eat their Thanksgiving meal as cigarette smoke and slot-machine clamor wafted over
                        their
                        cheeseburgers, Kristin and I locked eyes with an unspoken message: We ar­­e the world’s worst
                        parents.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We have avoided Las Vegas with the kids since then, but an aborted drive to slushy Aspen this
                        April with
                        three of our heirs caused us to pause in Vegas. At the time, the city was just awakening from
                        its Covid
                        slumber, with mandatory masks and limited capacity in most indoor spaces, traffic so light that
                        cars
                        were drag-racing down the normally packed Strip, and a lingering, troubling question over the
                        whole
                        place: Will this reopening really be safe?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But extraordinary things have been happening during this slumber, and while we were only going
                        to spend
                        one night there, we had so much fun that we ended up staying four. At first we spent most of our
                        time in
                        the relative safety of the outdoors, but then we started to relax along with the rest of the
                        city,
                        drowning our hands beneath the ubiquitous liquid sanitizer dispensers, masking up and heading
                        indoors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I knew things had shifted in Sin City when, while maneuvering the minivan through some seemingly
                        dicey
                        neighborhood between Downtown and the Strip, I noted on the back alley wall of a hair salon a
                        striking
                        mural depicting the cult outsider artist Henry Darger’s seven Vivian Girl warriors in their
                        trademark
                        yellow dresses. What were the Vivian Girls doing here?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Farther along, Vegas’s ghost-town adult stores, shuttered warehouses and other buildings were
                        also
                        sporting increasingly elaborate murals: a blood-squirting horned lizard spanning half a city
                        block; a
                        dog with an impressively slobbering tongue piloting an open cockpit plane; a colorful phoenix
                        and dragon
                        rising like fireworks from an empty parking lot — all producing collective surprised “Wows!”
                        from inside
                        our minivan.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Las Vegas, it seems, is emerging from the Covid crisis as a place of spectacle and creativity,
                        especially outside the air-conditioned gambling ghettos of the Strip.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Over the next four days we did a lot of walking, crawling, flying and even railroading, all of
                        it away
                        from the casinos. We explored the Arts District, an area that has gone into hyper drive — so
                        much so
                        that we waited 30 minutes to get into my once “secret” Colombian breakfast joint, Makers &
                        Finders — and
                        wandered along Spring Mountain Road, the hub of the city’s Chinatown, rapidly expanding
                        westward. In the
                        midcentury mecca of East Fremont Street, a $350 million investment by the tech titan Tony Hsieh,
                        who
                        died last year, has produced a boulevard of fantastical art installations, restored buildings
                        and a
                        sculptural playground surrounded by stacked shipping containers converted to boutiques and
                        cafes, all
                        guarded by a giant, fire-spewing, steel praying mantis.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Vegas is going through a cultural renaissance,” a former member of the city’s Arts Commission,
                        Brian
                        “Paco” Alvarez, told me in a recent telephone interview. “A lot of the local culture that comes
                        out of a
                        city with two million unusually creative people didn’t stop during the pandemic.”
