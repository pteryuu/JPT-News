            <img src="https://www.nps.gov/brca/learn/news/images/21-02-Spring-Operations-at-Bryce-NPS-Photo.jpg"
                class="img-fluid pt-3" alt="Responsive image">
            <p>
                With Spring Break comes a perennial increase to park visitation. Facilities are beginning to reopen,
                hours are
                extending, and modified shuttle service will soon resume to best serve our visitors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Please note that in order to protect the health of those who live, work, and visit national parks and
                National
                Park Service (NPS) facilities, face masks are now required in all park buildings and facilities,
                including the
                Visitor Center, park restrooms, shuttles, and concessioner buildings. Masks are also required on
                NPS-managed
                lands when physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as narrow or busy trails and all overlooks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently the park Visitor Center and Bookstore is open every day from 8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Hours
                will be
                extended to 6:00 p.m. on Sunday, March 14th and then to 8:00 p.m. on Sunday, May 9th. Visitor Center
                capacity
                continues to be limited with short wait times during peak hours, and while the Visitor Center museum is
                open,
                the park theater remains closed. Visitors can also support the park and shop online by visiting
                <a href="https://www.brycecanyon.org/">www.brycecanyon.org.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                As park roads begin to see more traffic, the Bryce Canyon Shuttle will begin service on Friday, April
                2nd.
                Riding the shuttle bus is free but requires payment of the park’s entrance fee. Shuttles arrive every 10
                to 15
                minutes and will run from April 2nd through October 17th beginning at 8:00 a.m. daily. Shuttles run
                until the
                last bus leaves the park at 6:15 p.m. with extended hours to 8:10 p.m. from May 21st through September
                26th.
                Shuttle capacity will be limited and social distancing between groups encouraged. All passengers will be
                required to wear a mask, and free masks will be available. Due to public health concerns, the 3-hour
                Rainbow
                Point bus tour is not scheduled to resume at this time. A reminder that vehicles over 20 feet are
                restricted
                from the Bryce Amphitheater parking areas (Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce Points) during
                shuttle hours,
                so be sure to take advantage of this service to see the park’s most iconic areas. Shuttle parking is
                available
                in Bryce Canyon City, the additional parking lot across from the Visitor Center, or at your hotel or
                campsite in
                Bryce Canyon City or within the park.
            </p>

            <p>
                Riding the shuttle is an excellent option to pair with camping in one of the park’s developed
                campgrounds. Loop
                A of North Campground remains open all winter for first-come-first-serve camping. Additional loops will
                open as
                weather permits. Sunset Campground will begin its season on April 15th with first-come-first-serve
                camping until
                May 20th, at which time reservations will be required through October 15th. Reservations can be made 6
                months in
                advance at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/">www.recreation.gov</a> or by calling 877-444-6777.
                Sunset Campground will return to
                first-come-first-serve camping on October 16th until it closes for the season on October 31st.
            </p>

                The Utah Department of Transportation is scheduled to begin construction work focused on roadway
                improvements
                and safety later this month. Work in the area of the park will focus on State Route 12 (SR-12) from its
                junction
                with State Route 63 (main park road) east to Henrieville. Improvements include the construction of a
                traffic
                roundabout at the junction, lane widening, pavement rehabilitation, and other upgrades. Traffic delays
                of up to
                15 minutes are possible at construction areas. Visit www.udot.utah.gov/sr12corridor for more
                information.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ranger programs will continue to be offered as the 2021 season unfolds. Visit www.nps.gov/brca and click

                Along with ranger programming, the park’s beloved annual festivals are also expected to resume in 2021
                with
                modifications for public health and safety. The Astronomy Festival is currently scheduled from June 9th
                – June
                12th, and the Geology Festival from July 9th – July 10th. The park’s summer Butterfly Count is scheduled
