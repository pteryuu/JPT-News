                Changi Airport
            </h3>
            <img
                src="https://www.visitsingapore.com/id_id/travel-guide-tips/travelling-to-singapore/changi-airport-singapore/_jcr_content/par-carousel/carousel_detailpage/carousel/item_1.thumbnail.carousel-img.740.416.jpg">
            <p>Changi Airport is the focal point of Singapore's status as a world-class aviation hub known as an
                unforgettable
                tourist destination. With its many awards, Singapore's premier airport offers a variety of exciting
                activities,
                from shopping and dining to entertainment.
                The airport consists of four terminals and Jewel Changi,a ten-storey lifestyle hub that neatly connects
                Terminals 1, 2 and 3, and combines the beauty of art, architecture and nature in the same space.
                Whether you're going to singapore for a stopover or a week-long holiday in this tropical paradise,
                Changi
                Airport will captivate you from the moment your plane lands. Here's a look at some of the charms of this
                place.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Nature is preserved
            </h3>
            <img
                src="https://www.visitsingapore.com/id_id/travel-guide-tips/travelling-to-singapore/changi-airport-singapore/_jcr_content/par/mobile_21_content_sl/sliderccpar1/content_img_insta/content/item1.thumbnail.image-path.350.197.jpg">
            <p>
                Just like Singapore—known around the world as the 'City in the Park'—Changi Airport houses green spaces
                and
                lush
                gardens for tourists who want to rest and relax after a long flight.
                To see the most spectacular part of the space, walk to Jewel Changi and discover the HSBC Rain Vortex, a
                40-metre indoor waterfall surrounded by tropical flora and more than 2,000 trees.
                Other smaller spaces are also less enthralling, including the Butterfly Garden in Terminal 3, the
                Sunflower
                Garden in Terminal 2, and the Cactus Garden in Terminal 1—which showcases more than 100 species of cacti
                and
                other dry climatic plants.
                Nature lovers visiting other parks will gain a deep insight into nature, as butterflies burst from their
                cocoons
                in the Emergence Enclosure
            </p>
            <h3>
                Fun for the whole family
            </h3>
            <img
                src="https://www.visitsingapore.com/id_id/travel-guide-tips/travelling-to-singapore/changi-airport-singapore/_jcr_content/par/mobile_21_content_sl/sliderccpar1/content_img_insta/content/item2.thumbnail.image-path.350.197.jpg">
            <p>
                There's no boredom at Changi Airport. Each airport terminal has a range of activities for all family
                members,
                including an indoor playground in Terminals 1 and 3, Singapore's tallest slide (located in the common
                area
                of
                Terminal 3), and a Family Zone in Terminal 2.
                Families traveling with their teenage children can play at the Entertainment Corner in Terminal 4—They
                can
                find
                Xbox Kinect games and classic arcade machines—or watch movies at changi's two cinemas (located in
                Terminals
                2
                and 3).
                In addition, you can walk to Jewel's highest floor and share the fun with your family at Canopy Park.
                This
                14,000 square meter space is full of exciting attractions, from labyrinthine gardens to mist-decorated
                play
                areas.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Mouthwatering dishes and shopping tours
            </h3>
            <img
                src="https://www.visitsingapore.com/id_id/travel-guide-tips/travelling-to-singapore/changi-airport-singapore/_jcr_content/par/mobile_21_content_sl/sliderccpar1/content_img_insta/content/item3.thumbnail.image-path.350.197.jpg">
            <p>
                A five-sense sensation awaits you at Changi Airport, with a variety of shopping and dining options.
                Jewel
                Changi
                itself houses more than 100 outlets, with 30 outlets open for 24 hours. In addition, the four terminals
                have
                their own choice of restaurants, dining halls and food courts.
                You can also dive into Singapore's retail havens throughout the airport, with a wide range of
                international
                brands from Apple to Zara. While you're there, be sure to check out your favorite local brands like
                Supermama.
